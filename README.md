## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to store and organize my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem is categorized based on difficulty, topic, and solving process. The repository is updated daily, and progress is reflected through a my dynamic chart on github.

## Structure

The structure of this repository is organized as follows:

- Each problem is stored in a separate folder named after the problem number and name.
- Each folder contains:
  - `solution.py` (or another programming language) - My solution to the problem.
  - `README.md` - Details about the problem, including:
    - Difficulty: Easy/Medium/Hard
    - Topic: Arrays, Sorting, Greedy, etc.
    - Solving Process: Optimal, Improved, etc.
    - Date Solved: The date I first solved the problem.
    - Revisit: Notes on when to revisit or what to improve.

## Daily Updates

I commit changes daily to reflect my progress on the problems I am solving. These updates ensure that there are consistent changes on the contribution graph, even if it's a small note, an improvement, or a completely new solution.
